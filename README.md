# Monopoly-Simulation
As an avid board game player, I was curious about what the optimal strategy was for property selection in Monopoly. While it's largely a game of luck, there are some spaces that tend to be landed on more often than others! In this project, I didn't intend to simulate multi-player games. Instead, I simply simulated many dice rolls and incorporated the rules of the game. Take a peek if you're curious about how to ruin your friendships, but win!
